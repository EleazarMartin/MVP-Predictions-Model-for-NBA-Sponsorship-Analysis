# NBA MVP Prediction with Random Forest  

## Overview  
This project develops a **Python-based Random Forest Classification model** to predict NBA MVP nominees based on **45 performance metrics** spanning **7 decades** of player statistics. By analyzing historical trends, the model provides insights into how MVP selection criteria have evolved over time.

## Features  
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements a **Random Forest Classifier** for MVP prediction.  
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Utilizes **7 decades of NBA player statistics** with 45 different metrics.  
- **Accuracy & Optimization**: Achieved **70% prediction accuracy**, addressing **class imbalance** through weighted hyperparameter adjustments.  
- **Historical MVP Trends**: Offers insights into shifting **MVP selection trends** over time.
